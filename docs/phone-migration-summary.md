# Phone-Based Authentication Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated Unveil from email-based to phone-based authentication for improved guest onboarding experience. This change enables SMS invitations and makes it easier for wedding guests to join and participate.

## ðŸ”„ Key Changes Made

- Updated CSV template to prioritize phone numbers
- Reordered column mappings to highlight phone first

### 3. Phone Utilities (`lib/utils.ts`)
Added comprehensive phone handling:

- `formatPhoneNumber()` - Real-time display formatting
- `normalizePhoneNumber()` - Database storage format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)

### 4. Database Helpers (`lib/supabase.ts`)
New phone-centric functions:
- `createUserProfile()` - Phone-based user creation
- `updateUserProfile()` - Profile updates
- `getUserByPhone()` - User lookup by phone
- `findGuestByPhone()` - Guest lookup for event access
- `linkGuestToUser()` - Connect guest records to user accounts

### 5. SMS Invitation System (`lib/sms-invitations.ts`)
Complete SMS messaging framework:
- Event invitation templates
- RSVP confirmation messages
- Event reminders and updates
- Phone validation for SMS sending
- Batch invitation processing

- Mock SMS provider (ready for Twilio integration)

### 6. UI Components (`components/guest-import/ColumnMapping.tsx`)
- Updated field options to require phone numbers
- Changed validation messaging
- Added success message for phone mapping
- Reordered field priorities

## ðŸŽ¯ New User Experience

### For Wedding Hosts:
1. Import guest lists with phone numbers (required)
2. Send SMS invitations directly from the platform
3. Guests can join via text message links
4. Track RSVPs and engagement via phone

### For Wedding Guests:
1. Receive SMS invitation with event link
2. Click link â†’ automatically prompted for phone verification
3. Enter phone number â†’ receive SMS code
4. Verify code â†’ instantly access event
5. Option to stay SMS-only or use full app

## ðŸš€ Next Steps Required

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Update users table to make phone primary, email optional
ALTER TABLE users 
  ALTER COLUMN email DROP NOT NULL,
  ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  ADD CONSTRAINT users_phone_or_email_check 
    CHECK (phone IS NOT NULL OR email IS NOT NULL);

-- Update event_guests to make phone required
ALTER TABLE event_guests 
  ALTER COLUMN phone SET NOT NULL,
  ALTER COLUMN guest_email DROP NOT NULL;

-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_phone ON users(phone);
CREATE INDEX idx_event_guests_phone ON event_guests(phone);
```

### Supabase Configuration
1. **Enable Phone Auth**: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Phone
2. **SMS Provider Setup**: Configure Twilio or preferred SMS service
3. **Rate Limiting**: Set appropriate SMS sending limits
4. **Environment Variables**: Add SMS provider credentials

### Production Considerations
- **SMS Costs**: Budget ~$0.01-0.05 per message
- **International Support**: Consider adding country code selection
- **Fallback Options**: Email backup for SMS delivery issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent SMS abuse
- **Phone Validation**: Use `libphonenumber-js` for robust validation

## ðŸ”§ Integration Points

### Guest Access Flow
```
1. Host imports guests with phone numbers
2. Host sends SMS invitations via platform
3. Guest receives: "You're invited! [link]"
4. Guest clicks â†’ phone verification â†’ event access
5. Guest can RSVP, upload photos, message hosts
```

### SMS Templates Available
- **Invitation**: Welcome message with event link
- **RSVP Confirmation**: Status confirmation
- **Reminders**: Event day reminders
- **Updates**: Host announcements

## ðŸ“Š Benefits Achieved

1. **Lower Friction**: No email signup required for guests
2. **Higher Engagement**: SMS has 98% open rate vs 20% email
3. **Universal Access**: Works on any phone (smartphone or basic)
4. **Real-time**: Instant delivery and verification
5. **Familiar**: Everyone knows how to receive/send texts

## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Phone number entry and formatting
- [ ] SMS OTP delivery and verification
- [ ] Guest import with phone requirements
- [ ] Guest list management with phone lookup
- [ ] SMS invitation sending (mock)
- [ ] Guest access via invitation links
- [ ] Profile creation for phone users
- [ ] Event access permissions

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Invalid phone numbers
- [ ] Duplicate phone numbers in import
- [ ] SMS delivery failures
- [ ] OTP expiration
- [ ] Guest access without prior registration
- [ ] Multiple events for same guest phone

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- Phone numbers are normalized and stored consistently

- Guest access is scoped to specific events
- No sensitive data in SMS messages
- STOP/opt-out functionality included
