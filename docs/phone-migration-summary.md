# Phone-Based Authentication Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated Unveil from email-based to phone-based authentication for improved guest onboarding experience. This change enables SMS invitations and makes it easier for wedding guests to join and participate.

## 🔄 Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Flow (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Email + magic link
- **After**: Phone number + SMS OTP verification
- Added two-step authentication flow (phone entry → OTP verification)
- Real-time phone number formatting as user types
- Validation for US phone numbers (10 or 11 digits)

### 2. Guest Import System (`lib/guest-import.ts`)
- **Primary identifier changed**: `guest_name` → `phone` (required)
- `guest_name` is now optional with phone number fallback
- Added phone number validation and normalization
- Duplicate phone detection during import
- Updated CSV template to prioritize phone numbers
- Reordered column mappings to highlight phone first

### 3. Phone Utilities (`lib/utils.ts`)
Added comprehensive phone handling:
- `isValidPhoneNumber()` - US number validation
- `formatPhoneNumber()` - Real-time display formatting
- `normalizePhoneNumber()` - Database storage format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)

### 4. Database Helpers (`lib/supabase.ts`)
New phone-centric functions:
- `createUserProfile()` - Phone-based user creation
- `updateUserProfile()` - Profile updates
- `getUserByPhone()` - User lookup by phone
- `findGuestByPhone()` - Guest lookup for event access
- `linkGuestToUser()` - Connect guest records to user accounts

### 5. SMS Invitation System (`lib/sms-invitations.ts`)
Complete SMS messaging framework:
- Event invitation templates
- RSVP confirmation messages
- Event reminders and updates
- Phone validation for SMS sending
- Batch invitation processing
- Deep link generation for guest access
- Mock SMS provider (ready for Twilio integration)

### 6. UI Components (`components/guest-import/ColumnMapping.tsx`)
- Updated field options to require phone numbers
- Changed validation messaging
- Added success message for phone mapping
- Reordered field priorities

## 🎯 New User Experience

### For Wedding Hosts:
1. Import guest lists with phone numbers (required)
2. Send SMS invitations directly from the platform
3. Guests can join via text message links
4. Track RSVPs and engagement via phone

### For Wedding Guests:
1. Receive SMS invitation with event link
2. Click link → automatically prompted for phone verification
3. Enter phone number → receive SMS code
4. Verify code → instantly access event
5. Option to stay SMS-only or use full app

## 🚀 Next Steps Required

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Update users table to make phone primary, email optional
ALTER TABLE users 
  ALTER COLUMN email DROP NOT NULL,
  ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE,
  ADD CONSTRAINT users_phone_or_email_check 
    CHECK (phone IS NOT NULL OR email IS NOT NULL);

-- Update event_guests to make phone required
ALTER TABLE event_guests 
  ALTER COLUMN phone SET NOT NULL,
  ALTER COLUMN guest_email DROP NOT NULL;

-- Add performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_users_phone ON users(phone);
CREATE INDEX idx_event_guests_phone ON event_guests(phone);
```

### Supabase Configuration
1. **Enable Phone Auth**: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → Phone
2. **SMS Provider Setup**: Configure Twilio or preferred SMS service
3. **Rate Limiting**: Set appropriate SMS sending limits
4. **Environment Variables**: Add SMS provider credentials

### Production Considerations
- **SMS Costs**: Budget ~$0.01-0.05 per message
- **International Support**: Consider adding country code selection
- **Fallback Options**: Email backup for SMS delivery issues
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent SMS abuse
- **Phone Validation**: Use `libphonenumber-js` for robust validation

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Guest Access Flow
```
1. Host imports guests with phone numbers
2. Host sends SMS invitations via platform
3. Guest receives: "You're invited! [link]"
4. Guest clicks → phone verification → event access
5. Guest can RSVP, upload photos, message hosts
```

### SMS Templates Available
- **Invitation**: Welcome message with event link
- **RSVP Confirmation**: Status confirmation
- **Reminders**: Event day reminders
- **Updates**: Host announcements

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

1. **Lower Friction**: No email signup required for guests
2. **Higher Engagement**: SMS has 98% open rate vs 20% email
3. **Universal Access**: Works on any phone (smartphone or basic)
4. **Real-time**: Instant delivery and verification
5. **Familiar**: Everyone knows how to receive/send texts

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Phone number entry and formatting
- [ ] SMS OTP delivery and verification
- [ ] Guest import with phone requirements
- [ ] Guest list management with phone lookup
- [ ] SMS invitation sending (mock)
- [ ] Guest access via invitation links
- [ ] Profile creation for phone users
- [ ] Event access permissions

### Edge Cases to Test
- [ ] Invalid phone numbers
- [ ] Duplicate phone numbers in import
- [ ] SMS delivery failures
- [ ] OTP expiration
- [ ] Guest access without prior registration
- [ ] Multiple events for same guest phone

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Phone numbers are normalized and stored consistently
- SMS OTP uses Supabase's built-in security
- Rate limiting prevents SMS spam
- Guest access is scoped to specific events
- No sensitive data in SMS messages
- STOP/opt-out functionality included
