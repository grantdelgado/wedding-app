# Project Risk Matrix

This document outlines potential risks for the Unveil project, their likelihood and impact, and planned mitigation strategies. It should be reviewed and updated periodically, especially at the start of new development phases.

## Risk Assessment Key

**Likelihood:**
- **High (H):** Very likely to occur.
- **Medium (M):** Moderately likely to occur.
- **Low (L):** Unlikely to occur.

**Impact:**
- **High (H):** Would cause significant disruption to project goals, timeline, budget, or quality.
- **Medium (M):** Would cause moderate disruption.
- **Low (L):** Would cause minor disruption.

**Overall Risk Level:** (Calculated or assessed based on Likelihood and Impact)
- **Critical (C):** Immediate attention and mitigation required.
- **High (H):** Significant attention and mitigation planning required.
- **Medium (M):** Monitor and have mitigation plans ready.
- **Low (L):** Monitor, minimal action required.

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Date Identified | Identified By | Risk Description                                  | Phase Affected (e.g., MVP Dev, Testing, Launch) | Likelihood (L/M/H) | Impact (L/M/H) | Overall Risk (L/M/H/C) | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 | Contingency Plan                                                                  | Owner          | Status (Open, Mitigating, Monitoring, Closed) |

| R001    | YYYY-MM-DD      | (Name/Role)   | Example: Key feature (e.g., real-time messaging) proves technically more complex than anticipated, delaying MVP. | MVP Dev                                         | M                  | H              | H                      | Allocate extra R&D time upfront for complex features; break down into smaller, manageable tasks. | Simplify MVP feature set; communicate delay transparently if unavoidable.         | Project Lead   | Open                                        |
| R002    | YYYY-MM-DD      | (Name/Role)   | Example: Supabase rate limits are hit during peak load at the live wedding event.                   | Testing, Launch                                 | L                  | H              | M                      | Optimize queries; implement caching; monitor Supabase usage dashboards; consider plan upgrade if necessary. | Have a plan to quickly identify and resolve bottlenecks; inform users of temporary issues. | Tech Lead      | Monitoring                                  |
| R003    | YYYY-MM-DD      | (Name/Role)   |                                                   |                                                 |                    |                |                        |                                                                                     |                                                                                   |                |                                             |
